## Summary

Ultradian rhythms are 90-minute cycles of alertness and focus that exist throughout the day and night. By understanding and optimizing these natural cycles, you can maximize neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to rewire and learn) and productivity.

## Key Points

### 1. Understanding Ultradian Rhythms
- **What they are:** 90-minute cycles of alertness & focus existing 24/7
- **Why they matter:** They maximize neuroplasticity and brain's learning ability
- **Science:** Controlled by the glucocorticoid system (cortisol release)
- **Impact:** Proper cortisol timing improves alertness, immune function, and focus

### 2. Identify Your Optimal Focus Peaks
Track your alertness for a few days to find peaks:
- **Morning Peak:** Between waking and noon
- **Afternoon Peak:** Between noon and ~6-7 PM
- **Morning boost:** Get sunlight soon after waking, use caffeine and/or light exercise
- **Note:** Grogginess is normal in the first hour after waking—cycles are still running

### 3. Schedule & Protect Focused Work Blocks
- **Block Length:** 90 minutes optimal
  - First 10-15 min: warm-up
  - Next ~60 min: peak deep focus (best for learning)
- **Environment:** Eliminate distractions (phone away, Wi-Fi off if possible)
- **Work type:** Cognitively demanding tasks, not email/social media
- **Consistency:** Do at least one block daily (even weekends) to make focus easier

### 4. Number of Blocks per Day
- **1-2 blocks/day:** Ideal & sustainable
- **3 blocks/day:** Exceptional (possible with careful scheduling)
- **4 blocks/day:** Rare, usually for intense short-term goals
- **Capturing extra blocks:** Wake earlier, get bright light, do short exercise burst

### 5. Recovery & Consolidation
- **Sleep is crucial:** Go to bed early to protect sleep quality and duration
- **Key insight:** Learning "sticks" during sleep & rest, not during work blocks
- **NSDR:** Non-Sleep Deep Rest (meditation/guided NSDR) speeds up consolidation

## How I'll Use This

Structure my day around two 90-minute deep work blocks, protecting morning time for most demanding cognitive work, ensuring consistent sleep for consolidation.

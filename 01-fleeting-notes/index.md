# Fleeting Notes

**Purpose:** Rapid capture inbox for quick thoughts, ideas, voice memos, and temporary snippets. This is deliberately a messy space for immediate capture.

## What Goes Here

- Quick thoughts and ideas
- Voice memo transcriptions
- Random observations
- Questions and curiosities
- Incomplete thoughts worth revisiting

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Write quickly without worrying about formatting
2. **Review** - Monthly review of all fleeting notes
3. **Promote** - Develop promising ideas into [Permanent Notes](../03-permanent-notes/index.md)
4. **Archive** - Move old or irrelevant notes to [Archive](../06-archive/index.md)

## Organization

Notes are organized by month for easy browsing:

| Period | Status |
|--------|--------|
| [2025-11](./2025-11) | Current |
| [2025-10](./2025-10) | Recent |

## Next Steps

- Review fleeting notes monthly for promotion
- Link promising ideas to related permanent notes
- Archive notes older than 3 months that won't be developed

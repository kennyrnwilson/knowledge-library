# Fleeting Notes

**Purpose:** Rapid capture inbox for quick thoughts, ideas, voice memos, and temporary snippets. This is deliberately a messy space for immediate capture.

## What Goes Here

- Quick thoughts and ideas
- Voice memo transcriptions
- Random observations
- Questions and curiosities
- Incomplete thoughts worth revisiting

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Write quickly without worrying about formatting
2. **Review** - Monthly review of all fleeting notes
3. **Promote** - Develop promising ideas into [Permanent Notes](../03-permanent-notes/index.md)
4. **Archive** - Move old or irrelevant notes to [Archive](../06-archive/index.md)

## Organization

All notes are kept in a single folder with descriptive filenames for easy browsing. Use the metadata (Created date) within each note to track when it was captured.

## Next Steps

- Link promising ideas to related permanent notes
- Archive notes older than 3 months that won't be developed
- Continue capturing new ideas and observations

# Books

**Purpose:** Summaries and notes from books you've read or are reading.

## Contents

| Book | Author | Status | Rating | Last Updated |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| TBD | | | | |

## How It Works

1. Create a [literature summary](../../.templates/literature-summary.md) for each book
2. Extract key takeaways
3. Link to relevant [Permanent Notes](../../03-permanent-notes/README.md)
4. Mark status: To Read, Reading, Completed, Archived

## How This Fits In

- **Source for:** [Permanent Notes](../../03-permanent-notes/README.md)
- **Part of:** [Literature Notes](../README.md)
- **Connects to:** [Book Reading List](../../03-permanent-notes/leisure/books/README.md)

## Next Steps

- Migrate reading list from Notion
- Add summaries for completed reads
- Link to relevant knowledge areas

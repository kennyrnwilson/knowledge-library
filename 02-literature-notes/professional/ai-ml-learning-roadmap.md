## Learning Recommendations

### Recommended Sequence
1. **Programming** → Core ML/DL → **Math/Stats** → **LLMs** → **MLOps**

### Key Notes for Learners
- **Free Audit:** Most Coursera/edX courses allow free auditing without needing to pay for certificates
- **Book Editions:** Always check for latest editions, especially in rapidly evolving ML/AI field
- **Practice First:** Books like "Hands-On Machine Learning" emphasize practical implementation over theory
- **Build Intuition:** Karpathy's courses focus on understanding how things work from first principles

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Beginner:** Start with Python for Everybody + CS50x + hands-on ML book
2. **Intermediate:** Add Andrew Ng specializations + math foundations
3. **Advanced:** LLM courses + MLOps + system design books
4. **Reference:** Keep "Hundred-Page ML Book" and mathematical texts for lookups

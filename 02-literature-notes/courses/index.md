# Courses

**Purpose:** Notes and summaries from online courses and structured learning programs.

## Contents

| Course | Platform | Topic | Status | Last Updated |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|--------------|
| TBD | | | | |

## How It Works

1. Create a [literature summary](../../.templates/literature-summary.md) for each course
2. Document key learnings by section
3. Link to relevant [Permanent Notes](../../03-permanent-notes/index.md)
4. Track status: Planning, In Progress, Completed, Archived

## How This Fits In

- **Source for:** [Permanent Notes](../../03-permanent-notes/index.md)
- **Part of:** [Literature Notes](../index.md)
- **Supports:** [Projects](../../05-projects/index.md) and learning goals

## Next Steps

- Add courses you're taking or planning
- Document learnings as you progress
- Create a course completion checklist

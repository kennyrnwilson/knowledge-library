# Literature Notes

**Purpose:** Curated summaries of external sources including books, articles, courses, and videos. These are starting points for deeper research and sources for your [Permanent Notes](../03-permanent-notes/index.md).

## What Goes Here

- Book summaries
- Article highlights
- Course learnings
- Video transcriptions
- Podcast notes

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Create a [literature summary](../.templates/literature-summary.md) as you consume content
2. **Synthesize** - Extract key ideas and concepts
3. **Link** - Connect to relevant [Permanent Notes](../03-permanent-notes/index.md)
4. **Review** - Periodically revisit to inform permanent knowledge

## Organization

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| [Books](./books/index.md) | Active | Completed and in-progress reads |
| [Articles](./articles/index.md) | Active | Research articles and long-form content |
| [Courses](./courses/index.md) | Active | Online courses and structured learning |

## How This Fits In

- **Source material** for creating permanent notes
- **Bridge** between raw consumption and structured knowledge
- **Record** of what you've learned and when
- **References** for future research and recall

## Next Steps

- Add summaries as you read/learn
- Link to related permanent notes regularly
- Use these to guide permanent note creation

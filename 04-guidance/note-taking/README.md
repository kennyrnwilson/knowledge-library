## Note-Taking Principles

### Effective Capture
1. **Capture Quickly** - Get ideas down without worrying about format
2. **Link Ideas** - Connect new notes to existing knowledge
3. **Use Your Words** - Paraphrase rather than copy directly
4. **Date and Source** - Always record when and where ideas came from
5. **Review Regularly** - Process notes into your system consistently

### Organization Strategies
- **Zettelkasten** - Interconnected note system with unique IDs
- **PARA** - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive
- **Hybrid** - Combine multiple organizational principles

### Active Learning
- **Spaced Repetition** - Review notes at increasing intervals
- **Elaboration** - Connect concepts together
- **Active Recall** - Test yourself on note content
- **Teach Back** - Explain concepts from your notes

## System Overview

Your knowledge management system uses a four-tier structure:

1. **Fleeting Notes** - Quick captures, temporary
2. **Literature Notes** - Summaries of external sources
3. **Permanent Notes** - Synthesized knowledge you own
4. **Guidance** - Procedures and frameworks for applying knowledge

## Best Practices

- Keep fleeting notes brief and capture-focused
- Write literature notes while consuming content
- Build permanent notes by connecting multiple sources
- Create guidance when you've identified useful procedures
- Review and update your notes regularly
- Link between notes to create knowledge networks

## Tools and Templates

- **Markdown Format** - Plain text, version controllable
- **Relative Links** - Connect notes within your system
- **Metadata** - Track status, dates, and sources
- **File Structure** - Organize hierarchically by topic

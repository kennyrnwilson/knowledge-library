## 🎯 Overview

### What This Stage Covers

Stage 3 transforms you from an AI application builder into a true AI Engineer who can architect, optimize, and scale production systems. This is the longest and most challenging stage, covering deep learning internals, MLOps infrastructure, inference optimization, advanced evaluation, security and safety, production RAG systems, and agent architectures.

**This stage separates junior from mid/senior-level engineers.** You'll move beyond using AI APIs to understanding how models work internally, how to optimize them for production, how to build robust MLOps pipelines, and how to architect complex AI systems. This typically takes 2-4 years of dedicated work and ongoing learning.

You'll master:
- Transformer architecture internals and how models actually work
- Production MLOps infrastructure with containerization, orchestration, and monitoring
- Model optimization techniques like quantization, distillation, and efficient serving
- Advanced evaluation, testing, and benchmarking strategies
- Security, safety, and compliance for AI systems
- Production-grade RAG systems with advanced retrieval
- Multi-agent systems and tool use at scale

### Who This Is For

- **Prerequisites**: Completed Stage 1 and Stage 2, have built multiple AI applications
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

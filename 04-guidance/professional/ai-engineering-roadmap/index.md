# 🚀 AI Engineering: Your Realistic Roadmap

**Purpose:** A comprehensive, realistic roadmap for becoming an AI Engineer—a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using foundation models through prompt engineering, RAG, and API integration.

## 🎯 Overview

### What This Roadmap Covers

This is a comprehensive, realistic roadmap for becoming an AI Engineer—a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using foundation models (like GPT-4, Claude) through prompt engineering, RAG, and API integration. Unlike many resources that promise quick results, this roadmap is honest: reaching professional competence takes years of dedicated part-time work, not months.

**The Key Insight**: An AI Engineer is NOT a data scientist who trains models from scratch. You're a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using pre-trained foundation models through prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and MLOps practices.

**Why This Roadmap Exists:**
- To provide a realistic, actionable path from beginner to professional AI Engineer
- To emphasize building real projects over consuming tutorials
- To set honest expectations about time commitment (2-6 years part-time)
- To focus on the skills that actually matter for AI Engineering jobs
- To help you build a portfolio that demonstrates real competence

**What You'll Be Able to Build:**
By completing this roadmap, you'll build production-ready AI applications:
- RAG systems that answer questions from your own documents
- AI agents that can use tools and reason through complex tasks
- Full-stack AI applications deployed to production
- Custom fine-tuned models for specific use cases
- Scalable AI infrastructure with monitoring and evaluation

### Who This Is For
- **Prerequisites**: Minimal coding experience (we start with Python basics)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Advanced (3 progressive stages)
- **Estimated Time**: 2-6 years for part-time study to reach senior level

## The Three Stages

## ⏱️ Time & Prerequisites

### Prerequisites

**Before starting this roadmap, you should:**
- [ ] Have access to a computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- [ ] Be willing to commit 1-2 hours/day consistently
- [ ] Have budget for API costs ($20-50/month for Stage 2+)
- [ ] Be comfortable learning independently

**You DON'T need:**
- Advanced math background (we teach what you need)
- Expensive hardware or GPUs (we use cloud APIs)
- Computer science degree
- Prior programming experience (we start from basics)

### Time Estimates

**To become job-ready (complete Stages 1 & 2):**
- **Minimum** (if you're fast and focused): 12-18 months
- **Typical** (part-time, 1-2 hours/day): 18-30 months
- **With full dedication** (4+ hours/day): 6-12 months

**To reach senior level (complete all 3 stages):**
- **Part-time commitment**: 2-6 years
- **Full-time bootcamp intensity**: 1-2 years

**Daily commitment**:
- Minimum: 30 minutes/day (slow but steady progress)
- Recommended: 1-2 hours/day (balanced pace)
- Intensive: 3-4 hours/day (career transition mode)

**Monthly costs**:
- Stage 1: $0-20 (mostly free)
- Stage 2: $20-50 (API experimentation)
- Stage 3: $50-200 (cloud compute, GPU time)

## Recommended Learning Sequence

1. **Pick Your Entry Point**
   - No programming experience? → Start with Stage 1

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to do all of Stage 1?"
Not necessarily. If you already know Python, APIs, and databases, you can skip sections. See Stage 1 for self-assessment.

### "Can I jump to Stage 2 without Stage 1?"
If you're already a strong software engineer (5+ years), yes. Otherwise, Stage 1 fundamentals are important.

### "How is this different from ML bootcamps?"
This focuses on **AI application engineering** (building with existing models) rather than ML research. It's more practical and job-focused.

### "What if I want to do research or training models?"
You'll need additional math and research papers. See Stage 3 recommendations. This roadmap is for AI **engineers**, not researchers.

### "Is this course/content?"
No! This is a **learning path guide** with links to real courses, documentation, and resources. You'll learn by building real projects.

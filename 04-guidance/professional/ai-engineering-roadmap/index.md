# 🚀 AI Engineering: Your Realistic Roadmap

**Purpose:** A comprehensive, progressive learning path to become an AI Engineer - a software engineer who builds with foundation models and AI systems.

**Time to Job-Ready:** 18-24 months of consistent learning
**Time to Senior Level:** 2-6 years part-time

## What This Roadmap Covers

This is a realistic, project-based learning path that takes you from complete beginner to senior-level AI Engineer. It's designed around what's actually needed in production, not theory.

### Key Principles

- **Learn by Building:** Hands-on projects at every stage
- **Production-Focused:** Emphasis on real-world deployment challenges
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Clear stages with defined completion criteria
- **Current (2025):** Covers modern tools and practices
- **Practical Timeline:** Realistic time estimates for part-time learners

## The Three Stages

| Stage | Duration | Goal | Job-Ready | Key Skills |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| [Stage 1: Foundational Skills](./stage-1-foundational-skills/index.md) | 6-12 months | Master Python, APIs, databases, Git | No | Software engineering fundamentals |
| [Stage 2: Working with AI Tools](./stage-2-working-with-ai-tools/index.md) | 12-18 months | Build AI applications, RAG systems | **Yes** | AI APIs, prompt engineering, RAG |
| [Stage 3: Advanced AI Engineering](./stage-3-advanced-ai-engineering/index.md) | 2-4 years | Production infrastructure, MLOps | **Senior** | Deep learning, infrastructure, optimization |

## Recommended Learning Sequence

1. **Pick Your Entry Point**
   - No programming experience? → Start with Stage 1
   - Know Python? → Start with Stage 2
   - Senior engineer? → Focus on Stage 3 gaps

2. **Complete Each Stage**
   - Read and understand core concepts
   - Complete learning checklist
   - Build the recommended projects
   - Meet completion criteria

3. **Build Portfolio**
   - Every stage includes 5 projects
   - Deploy real applications
   - Get user feedback
   - Document and share

4. **Move to Next Stage**
   - Only after completing projects
   - Only after meeting completion criteria
   - Review and consolidate learning

## Realistic Timeline Check

### Part-Time (10-15 hours/week)
- **Stage 1:** 6-12 months
- **Stage 2:** 12-18 months
- **Job-Ready:** 18-30 months total

### Full-Time (40+ hours/week)
- **Stage 1:** 2-3 months
- **Stage 2:** 3-4 months
- **Job-Ready:** 6-8 months total

### Very Part-Time (5-10 hours/week)
- **Stage 1:** 12-24 months
- **Stage 2:** 18-24 months
- **Job-Ready:** 30-48 months total

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to do all of Stage 1?"
Not necessarily. If you already know Python, APIs, and databases, you can skip sections. See Stage 1 for self-assessment.

### "Can I jump to Stage 2 without Stage 1?"
If you're already a strong software engineer (5+ years), yes. Otherwise, Stage 1 fundamentals are important.

### "How is this different from ML bootcamps?"
This focuses on **AI application engineering** (building with existing models) rather than ML research. It's more practical and job-focused.

### "What if I want to do research or training models?"
You'll need additional math and research papers. See Stage 3 recommendations. This roadmap is for AI **engineers**, not researchers.

### "Is this course/content?"
No! This is a **learning path guide** with links to real courses, documentation, and resources. You'll learn by building real projects.

## FAQ & Common Questions

### Q: "I want to use ChatGPT in my app - where do I start?"
→ Jump to [Stage 2: Working with AI Tools](./stage-2-working-with-ai-tools/index.md)

### Q: "What's the difference between learning ML vs AI Engineering?"
→ ML focuses on training models from data. AI Engineering focuses on building with **existing** models. This is AI Engineering.

### Q: "Can I do this while working a full-time job?"
→ Yes! 10-15 hours/week means 18-24 months to job-ready. See realistic timeline above.

### Q: "What programming language should I use?"
→ Python. It's the standard for AI and is beginner-friendly.

### Q: "Do I need GPU to learn?"
→ Not immediately. Stage 1 and early Stage 2 can run on CPU. GPU helpful for Stage 2 onwards, but not required.

### Q: "Should I focus on open-source or commercial models?"
→ Start with commercial (OpenAI, Anthropic). They're easier and more reliable. Learn open-source models in Stage 2/3.

## Getting Started

1. **Assess your current level**
   - Complete beginner? → Stage 1
   - Know Python? → Stage 2
   - 5+ years as engineer? → Stage 2 or Stage 3

2. **Set time commitment**
   - How many hours per week can you dedicate?
   - Be realistic - consistency matters more than intensity

3. **Pick first project**
   - Each stage has project specifications
   - Start with the first one in your stage
   - Build something you care about

4. **Track progress**
   - Use the completion checklists
   - Document your projects
   - Share progress with community

5. **Build portfolio**
   - Deploy every project
   - Write documentation
   - Get real users or feedback
   - Blog about what you learned

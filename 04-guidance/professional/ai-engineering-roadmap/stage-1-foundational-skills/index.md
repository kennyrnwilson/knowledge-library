# 📚 Stage 1: Foundational Skills

Master Python, Git, APIs, databases, and software engineering fundamentals—the essential skills you need before working with AI tools.

---

## 🎯 Overview

### What This Stage Covers

Stage 1 is your foundation for AI Engineering. You'll master the essential programming, data, and engineering skills that form the bedrock of AI work. This stage covers Python fundamentals, software engineering practices, data manipulation, web development basics, command-line tools, and optional math foundations.

**Without these fundamentals, you'll struggle with AI tools.** This stage is NOT optional—it's the difference between hacking together demos and building production systems. Many beginners want to jump straight to AI. Resist this urge. The time you invest in fundamentals will 10x your ability to learn AI concepts later.

You'll learn to:
- Write clean, professional Python code with proper testing and documentation
- Work with data using pandas, SQL, and databases
- Build REST APIs and web applications
- Use Git for version control and collaborate on code
- Navigate the command line and deploy applications
- Think like an engineer, not just a coder

### Who This Is For

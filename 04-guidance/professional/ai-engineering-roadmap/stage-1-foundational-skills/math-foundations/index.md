## Probability & Statistics Basics

Essential for understanding model behavior.

### Probability Fundamentals

- [ ] **Probability basics** (0 to 1)
- [ ] **Conditional probability**
- [ ] **Independent events**
- [ ] **Bayes' theorem** (intuition, not formula)
- [ ] **Common distributions** (normal, exponential)

### Descriptive Statistics

- [ ] **Mean, median, mode**
- [ ] **Standard deviation** (spread)
- [ ] **Variance**
- [ ] **Percentiles and quartiles**
- [ ] **Correlation** (relationship between variables)

**Practice:** Calculate stats on real datasets

### Inferential Statistics

- [ ] **Partial derivatives** (multiple variables)
- [ ] **Gradient** (direction of steepest increase)
- [ ] **Chain rule** (for composite functions)
- [ ] **Intuition over calculation**

**Useful for:** Understanding backpropagation (Stage 3)

### Optimization

- [ ] **Finding maxima/minima**
- [ ] **Gradient descent** intuition

### When to Study This

**Timeline:**
- **Stage 1**: Optional, focus on programming first
- **Stage 2**: Some helpful for understanding RAG/evaluation
- **Stage 3**: Important for deep learning (but can learn just-in-time)

**Recommendation:**
- Start with basics if interested
- Don't get bogged down in proofs
- Focus on intuition and application
- Learn more as needed in later stages

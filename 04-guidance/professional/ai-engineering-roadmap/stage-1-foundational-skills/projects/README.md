### How to Complete Projects

1. **Choose based on interest** - you'll spend weeks on this
2. **Start with scope** - what are you building?
3. **Design before coding** - sketch API, database schema, etc.
4. **Build incrementally** - small features that work
5. **Test as you go** - don't test everything at the end
6. **Document continuously** - document as you code
7. **Deploy early** - get it online sooner
8. **Iterate** - improve based on feedback
9. **Showcase it** - write blog post, share with community

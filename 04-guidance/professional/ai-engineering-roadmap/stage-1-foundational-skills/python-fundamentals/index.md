# Python Fundamentals

**Goal:** Master Python programming from basics to professional practices

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 months part-time

## Overview

This section takes you from zero to professional Python developer. You'll master the language fundamentals, modern tooling, and best practices needed for production code.

## Learning Path

### Setup & Environment
- **[Environment Setup by Operating System](./environment-setup.md)**
  - Windows Installation
  - WSL Installation (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  - Mac and Linux setup
  - Virtual environments

### Modern Tooling (2025)
- **[Modern Python Project Setup](./modern-project-setup.md)**
  - Project structure (src-layout)
  - pyproject.toml configuration
  - Testing setup
  - Linting and formatting
  - CI/CD basics

- **[Modern Python Dependency Management: Poetry vs Pipenv](./dependency-management.md)**
  - Poetry (recommended)
  - Pipenv (alternative)
  - When to use each
  - Migrating between tools

- **[Coding Python in VS Code (2025)](./vs-code-setup.md)**
  - IDE setup
  - Debugging with pdb
  - Testing integration
  - Essential extensions
  - IntelliSense configuration

### Core Concepts
- **[Core Python Fundamentals](./core-concepts/index.md)**
  - Basic Syntax & Data Types
  - Control Flow (if/else, loops)
  - Data Structures (lists, dicts, tuples, sets)
  - Functions & Modular Code
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Error Handling & Debugging

### Professional Python
- **[Professional Python Skills](./professional-skills.md)**
  - Standard Library modules
  - Package management
  - Code style (PEP 8, Black)
  - Type checking (mypy)
  - Testing practices

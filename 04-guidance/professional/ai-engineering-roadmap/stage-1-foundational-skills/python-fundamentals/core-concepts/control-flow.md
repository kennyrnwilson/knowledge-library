## ✅ Learning Checklist

- [ ] Write basic if/elif/else conditional statements
- [ ] Use boolean expressions and test truthiness
- [ ] Create nested conditional logic
- [ ] Write a ternary operator (conditional expression)
- [ ] Iterate over sequences using for loops
- [ ] Use range() for numeric iteration
- [ ] Use enumerate() to get indices while looping
- [ ] Practice unpacking in loops
- [ ] Write while loops with proper conditions
- [ ] Implement loop counter patterns
- [ ] Use break statement to exit loops early
- [ ] Use continue statement to skip iterations
- [ ] Implement else clause with loops
- [ ] Write basic list comprehensions
- [ ] Write list comprehensions with filtering conditions
- [ ] Create nested comprehensions

- [ ] Combine multiple control structures
- [ ] Refactor loops into comprehensions where appropriate

### Common Patterns

```python
# For loop with condition
for item in items:
    if condition(item):
        process(item)

# List comprehension
[x for x in items if condition(x)]

# Nested iteration
for row in matrix:
    for col in row:
        process(col)
```

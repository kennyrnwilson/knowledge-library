# Control Flow

Master if/else statements, loops, and list comprehensions.

## Key Concepts

- **Conditional Statements** (if/elif/else)
- **Loops** (for, while)
- **Loop Control** (break, continue)
- **Comprehensions** (List, dict, set)
- **Nested Control Flow**

## Topics Covered

### if/elif/else Statements
- Boolean expressions
- Truthiness in Python
- Multiple conditions
- Nested conditions
- Ternary operator (conditional expression)

### For Loops
- Iterating over sequences
- range() function
- enumerate() for indices
- Unpacking in loops
- Nested loops

### While Loops
- Loop conditions
- Infinite loops (and avoiding them)
- Loop counter patterns
- While vs for loops

### Loop Control
- break statement
- continue statement
- else clause with loops
- When to use each

### List Comprehensions
- Basic syntax
- Filtering with conditions
- Nested comprehensions
- Performance vs readability

### Dictionary & Set Comprehensions
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Set comprehensions
- Alternatives to comprehensions

## Common Patterns

```python
# For loop with condition
for item in items:
    if condition(item):
        process(item)

# List comprehension
[x for x in items if condition(x)]

# Nested iteration
for row in matrix:
    for col in row:
        process(col)
```

## Learning Time

1-2 weeks with practice.

## Exercises

- Write conditional logic
- Create loops for data processing
- Use break and continue effectively
- Write list comprehensions
- Combine multiple control structures

# 🚀 AI Engineering: Your Realistic Roadmap

**Purpose:** A comprehensive, realistic roadmap for becoming an AI Engineer—a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using foundation models through prompt engineering, RAG, and API integration.

## 🎯 Overview

This is a comprehensive, realistic roadmap for becoming an AI Engineer—a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using foundation models (like GPT-4, Claude) through prompt engineering, RAG, and API integration. Unlike many resources that promise quick results, this roadmap is honest: reaching professional competence takes years of dedicated part-time work, not months.

**The Key Insight**: An AI Engineer is NOT a data scientist who trains models from scratch. You're a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using pre-trained foundation models through prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and MLOps practices.

## The Three Stages

| Stage | Duration | Goal | Job-Ready | Key Skills |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| [Stage 1: Foundational Skills](./stage-1-foundational-skills/README.md) | 6-12 months | Master Python, APIs, databases, Git | No | Software engineering fundamentals |
| [Stage 2: Working with AI Tools](./stage-2-working-with-ai-tools/README.md) | 12-18 months | Build AI applications, RAG systems | **Yes** | AI APIs, prompt engineering, RAG |
| [Stage 3: Advanced AI Engineering](./stage-3-advanced-ai-engineering/README.md) | 2-4 years | Production infrastructure, MLOps | **Senior** | Deep learning, infrastructure, optimization |

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to do all of Stage 1?"
Not necessarily. If you already know Python, APIs, and databases, you can skip sections. See Stage 1 for self-assessment.

### "Can I jump to Stage 2 without Stage 1?"
If you're already a strong software engineer (5+ years), yes. Otherwise, Stage 1 fundamentals are important.

### "How is this different from ML bootcamps?"
This focuses on **AI application engineering** (building with existing models) rather than ML research. It's more practical and job-focused.

### "What if I want to do research or training models?"
You'll need additional math and research papers. See Stage 3 recommendations. This roadmap is for AI **engineers**, not researchers.

### "Is this course/content?"
No! This is a **learning path guide** with links to real courses, documentation, and resources. You'll learn by building real projects.

## FAQ & Common Questions

### Q: "I want to use ChatGPT in my app - where do I start?"
→ Jump to [Stage 2: Working with AI Tools](./stage-2-working-with-ai-tools/README.md)

### Q: "What's the difference between learning ML vs AI Engineering?"
→ ML focuses on training models from data. AI Engineering focuses on building with **existing** models. This is AI Engineering.

### Q: "Can I do this while working a full-time job?"
→ Yes! 10-15 hours/week means 18-24 months to job-ready. See realistic timeline above.

### Q: "What programming language should I use?"
→ Python. It's the standard for AI and is beginner-friendly.

### Q: "Do I need GPU to learn?"
→ Not immediately. Stage 1 and early Stage 2 can run on CPU. GPU helpful for Stage 2 onwards, but not required.

### Q: "Should I focus on open-source or commercial models?"
→ Start with commercial (OpenAI, Anthropic). They're easier and more reliable. Learn open-source models in Stage 2/3.

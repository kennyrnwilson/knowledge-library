## 🎯 Overview

This is a comprehensive, realistic roadmap for becoming an AI Engineer—a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using foundation models (like GPT-4, Claude) through prompt engineering, RAG, and API integration. Unlike many resources that promise quick results, this roadmap is honest: reaching professional competence takes years of dedicated part-time work, not months.

**The Key Insight**: An AI Engineer is NOT a data scientist who trains models from scratch. You're a specialized software engineer who builds and deploys applications using pre-trained foundation models through prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and MLOps practices.

## The Three Stages

| Stage | Goal | Job-Ready | Key Skills |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| [Stage 1: Foundational Skills](./stage-1-foundational-skills/README.md) | Master Python, APIs, databases, Git | No | Software engineering fundamentals |
| [Stage 2: Working with AI Tools](./stage-2-working-with-ai-tools/README.md) | Build AI applications, RAG systems | **Yes** | AI APIs, prompt engineering, RAG |
| [Stage 3: Advanced AI Engineering](./stage-3-advanced-ai-engineering/README.md) | Production infrastructure, MLOps | **Senior** | Deep learning, infrastructure, optimization |

## 🎯 Overview

### What This Stage Covers

Stage 2 is where you transition from learning Python to becoming an **AI Builder**. This stage focuses on building practical AI applications using existing models and APIs—the core skill that defines modern AI Engineering. You'll learn to integrate foundation models, master prompt engineering, build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, and create a portfolio of real projects.

This is the most important stage for breaking into AI Engineering. While Stage 1 taught you to code, Stage 2 teaches you to build AI applications that solve real problems. Most job-ready AI engineers spend significant time mastering these skills.

**Why This Matters for AI Engineering:**
- 90% of production AI work involves integrating existing models, not training from scratch
- Prompt engineering and RAG are the primary tools for adapting models to specific tasks
- Building a strong portfolio here is what gets you your first AI Engineering role
- These skills are immediately applicable to freelance projects and startups

**What You'll Be Able to Build:**
- Production-ready chatbots with memory and streaming
- RAG applications that answer questions from your own documents
- AI agents that can use tools and reason through multi-step tasks
- Full-stack AI applications deployed to production
- Custom fine-tuned models when needed

### Who This Is For
- **Prerequisites**: Completed Stage 1 (solid Python skills, git, APIs, basic ML concepts)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

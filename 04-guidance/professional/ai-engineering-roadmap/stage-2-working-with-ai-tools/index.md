# 📚 Stage 2: Working with AI Tools

Transition from learning Python to becoming an AI Builder. Master AI APIs, prompt engineering, RAG systems, and build a portfolio of production-ready AI applications.

---

## 🎯 Overview

### What This Stage Covers

Stage 2 is where you transition from learning Python to becoming an **AI Builder**. This stage focuses on building practical AI applications using existing models and APIs—the core skill that defines modern AI Engineering. You'll learn to integrate foundation models, master prompt engineering, build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, and create a portfolio of real projects.

This is the most important stage for breaking into AI Engineering. While Stage 1 taught you to code, Stage 2 teaches you to build AI applications that solve real problems. Most job-ready AI engineers spend 12-18 months mastering these skills.

**Why This Matters for AI Engineering:**
- 90% of production AI work involves integrating existing models, not training from scratch
- Prompt engineering and RAG are the primary tools for adapting models to specific tasks
- Building a strong portfolio here is what gets you your first AI Engineering role
- These skills are immediately applicable to freelance projects and startups

**What You'll Be Able to Build:**
- Production-ready chatbots with memory and streaming
- RAG applications that answer questions from your own documents
- AI agents that can use tools and reason through multi-step tasks
- Full-stack AI applications deployed to production
- Custom fine-tuned models when needed

### Who This Is For
- **Prerequisites**: Completed Stage 1 (solid Python skills, git, APIs, basic ML concepts)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate
- **Estimated Time**: 12-18 months for part-time study

## 🗺️ Learning Path

### Recommended Sequence

Work through these sections in this order:

**1. 2.1 AI APIs Integration**
- What it covers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere APIs; function calling; cost optimization
- Why start here: Foundation for everything else—you need to know how to call models
- Time estimate: 2-3 weeks

**2. 2.2 Prompt Engineering**
- What it covers: Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, advanced prompting patterns
- Why this next: Your primary tool for adapting models—master this before anything else
- Time estimate: 3-4 weeks

**3. 2.3 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- What it covers: Embeddings, vector databases, chunking strategies, building RAG systems
- Why this next: THE most important skill for production AI—connects models to your data
- Time estimate: 4-6 weeks

**4. 2.4 Pre-trained Models**
- What it covers: HuggingFace ecosystem, model selection, fine-tuning basics
- Why this next: Understand when to use which models and when fine-tuning makes sense
- Time estimate: 2-3 weeks

**5. 2.5 Evaluation Metrics**
- What it covers: Building eval systems, metrics, A/B testing, LLM-as-judge
- Why this next: Critical for systematic improvement—build this early, not as afterthought
- Time estimate: 2-3 weeks

**6. 2.6 Projects to Build**
- What it covers: 5 portfolio projects from chatbots to full-stack AI apps
- Why finish here: Portfolio projects that demonstrate your skills to employers
- Time estimate: 8-12 weeks (ongoing throughout stage)

### Alternative Paths

If you have specific project goals, you can adapt the order:
- **Building a chatbot first?** Do 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.6 (Project 1), then come back to 2.3
- **Working with documents?** Do 2.1 → 2.3 → 2.2 → 2.6 (Project 2)
- **Research-focused?** Add more time to 2.4 and 2.5 for deeper model understanding

## ⏱️ Time & Prerequisites

### Prerequisites

**Before starting this stage, you should:**
- [ ] Solid Python programming skills (functions, classes, error handling)
- [ ] Git and GitHub basics (clone, commit, push, pull)
- [ ] Understanding of APIs and HTTP requests
- [ ] Basic command line/terminal proficiency
- [ ] Familiarity with web development concepts (helpful but not required)
- [ ] Conceptual understanding of ML (from Stage 1)

**If you're missing prerequisites**: Go back to Stage 1: Foundational Skills

### Time Estimates

- **Minimum** (if you're quick and focused): 6-9 months
- **Typical** (part-time, 1-2 hours/day): 12-18 months
- **With full dedication** (4+ hours/day): 4-6 months

**Daily commitment**:
- Minimum: 1 hour/day (mostly on weekends)
- Recommended: 1-2 hours/day consistently
- Intensive: 3-4 hours/day if career-switching

**Budget Considerations**:
- API costs: $20-50/month for experimentation
- Courses: $0-100 (most resources are free)
- Vector DB hosting: $0-20/month (free tiers available)

## ✅ Completion Criteria

### You're ready to move to Stage 3 when you can:

**Core Skills**
- [ ] Build a RAG application from scratch without following tutorials
- [ ] Optimize prompts systematically using evaluation frameworks
- [ ] Integrate multiple AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) into applications
- [ ] Explain architectural decisions for AI applications
- [ ] Debug AI application issues (model behavior, not just code bugs)
- [ ] Estimate costs and latency for AI features accurately

**Projects Completed**
- [ ] Built and deployed at least 3 substantial AI applications
- [ ] Created a RAG system that works with real documents
- [ ] Implemented an AI agent that uses multiple tools

## 🚀 Quick Start

Want to automate your Python project setup?

1. **Read:** [Claude Code Quick Start](./claude-code-setup/01-quick-start.md)
2. **Install:** Copy `02-instructions.md` to Claude Code instructions folder
3. **Use:** Ask Claude Code to create a project
4. **Done:** Project created with full professional setup

---

## 💡 Motivation

These guides exist because:

1. **Learning vs. Doing:** The roadmap teaches concepts; these guides automate execution
2. **Time Savings:** Professional setup takes ~15 minutes manually, seconds with automation
3. **Consistency:** Same setup every time, no manual errors
4. **Team Sharing:** Share configurations across your team easily
5. **Best Practices:** Embedded professional standards in automation

### [Claude Code Setup Guide](./python/claude-code-setup/)

Automated professional Python project setup using Claude Code.

**Inspired by:** [VS Code Python Development Guide](../ai-engineering-roadmap/stage-1-foundational-skills/python-fundamentals/vs-code-python-development.md)

**Contents:**
- [Quick Start](./python/claude-code-setup/01-quick-start.md) - 3-minute installation
- [Instructions File](./python/claude-code-setup/02-instructions.md) - Claude Code instructions
- [Detailed Setup Guide](./python/claude-code-setup/03-detailed-setup-guide.md) - Complete walkthrough

**What It Does:**
Ask Claude Code: `"Create a new Python project called 'my-project'"`

Claude Code will automatically:
- Create full project structure
- Initialize git
- Set up virtual environment
- Generate configuration files
- Install dependencies
- Verify everything works

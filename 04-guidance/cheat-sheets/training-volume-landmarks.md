## 📊 Volume Classification System

Think of these as the "zones" of training volume. Each represents a different training effect:

### 🔋 **MV** — Maintenance Volume
*Minimum weekly volume needed to maintain strength and muscle*

- **📌 Purpose:** Recovery weeks, deload periods
- **⚡ Effect:** Maintains without stimulus for growth
- **📍 Use Case:** Low activity weeks, injury recovery
- **💡 Example:** Cutting volume by 40-50% for a recovery week

### 🌱 **MEV** — Minimum Effective Volume
*Lowest volume that produces meaningful muscle growth*

- **📌 Purpose:** Baseline stimulus for muscle development
- **⚡ Effect:** Slow but consistent gains
- **📍 Use Case:** Beginners, limited training time
- **💡 Example:** Starting point for a new muscle group

### 🎯 **MAV** — Maximum Adaptive Volume
*Highest volume that produces benefit before diminishing returns*

- **📌 Purpose:** Optimal growth stimulus with manageable fatigue
- **⚡ Effect:** Ideal for lean gains without overtraining
- **📍 Use Case:** Most trainees, most training phases
- **💡 Example:** Sweet spot for sustained progress

### 🔥 **MRV** — Maximum Recoverable Volume
*Highest volume that can be recovered from in a training week*

- **📌 Purpose:** Upper threshold before overtraining risk
- **⚡ Effect:** High fatigue—requires excellent recovery
- **📍 Use Case:** Advanced trainees, short peaking blocks
- **💡 Example:** Short-term push before deload

## Volume Landmarks by Muscle Group

| Muscle Group | MV | MEV | MAV | MRV | Frequency |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| Chest | 4-6 | 6-10 | 14-20 | 22-30 | 2x/week |
| Back | 4-6 | 6-10 | 14-20 | 22-30 | 2x/week |
| Shoulders | 6-8 | 10-15 | 18-25 | 28-35 | 2-3x/week |
| Biceps | 4-6 | 5-8 | 12-18 | 20-28 | 2x/week |
| Triceps | 4-6 | 5-8 | 12-18 | 20-28 | 2x/week |
| Forearms | 0-2 | 2-4 | 8-12 | 12-18 | 1x/week |
| Quads | 6-10 | 8-12 | 16-24 | 28-40 | 2-3x/week |
| Hamstrings | 4-6 | 6-10 | 14-20 | 22-30 | 2x/week |
| Calves | 2-4 | 4-6 | 10-15 | 16-20 | 2-3x/week |
| Glutes | 0-4 | 0-6 | 10-18 | 18-30 | 1-2x/week |
| Abs | 0-3 | 3-6 | 10-20 | 20-30 | 2-3x/week |
| Traps | 2-4 | 4-6 | 10-15 | 15-20 | 1-2x/week |

## 🎯 How to Use This System

### 1️⃣ **Identify Your Goal**

Pick your training objective, then choose the volume range:

| Goal | Volume | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 💪 **Muscle Growth** | MEV → MAV | Progressive growth with manageable fatigue |
| 💪 **Strength Focus** | MEV | Lower volume, heavier loads |
| 😴 **Maintenance** | MV | Recovery weeks, injury recovery |
| 🔥 **Peak Performance** | MAV → MRV | 4-6 weeks high volume, then deload |

### 2️⃣ **Choose Your Starting Point**

```
🟢 Beginner    → Start at MEV (play it safe)
🟡 Intermediate → Train MEV-MAV range (sweet spot)
🔴 Advanced    → MAV-MRV with planned deloads (requires discipline)
```

### 3️⃣ **Follow the Training Block**

| Week | Phase | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| **1-3** | Build | Establish baseline volume for each muscle |
| **4-8** | Accumulate | Gradually progress toward target volume |
| **9-12** | Deload | Reduce to MV (50% volume), recover fully |
| **13+** | Repeat | Start new cycle 5-10% higher |

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

✅ **Progressive Overload** — Gradually increase volume over 4-8 weeks
✅ **Deload is Essential** — Prevents injury and resets fatigue
✅ **Individual Variation** — Your MEV/MAV differs from others
✅ **Compound Movements First** — Get heavy compounds in before isolation
✅ **Form > Volume** — Bad form with high volume = wasted effort

---

## 📈 Monitoring Your Progress

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Weekly Volume Increase** | 5-10% | Track reps × weight each week |
| **Performance** | Steady gains | Strength going up = volume working |
| **Fatigue Level** | Manageable | Should feel worked, not wrecked |
| **Sleep Quality** | Excellent | Poor sleep = reduce volume |

**💡 Troubleshooting:**
- **Stalled progress?** → Check sleep & nutrition first
- **Constantly fatigued?** → You're above your MRV—deload now
- **No soreness?** → Volume may be below MEV—increase it

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | ❌ Problem | ✅ Solution |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Too Much Volume Too Soon** | Overtraining, injury | Start at MEV, progress slowly |
| **Never Deloading** | Accumulated fatigue, plateaus | Deload every 12 weeks minimum |
| **Ignoring Recovery** | High volume + poor sleep = disaster | Volume × Recovery Quality = Gains |
| **Wrong Frequency** | Large muscles undertrained | Train chest/back 2-3x/week |
| **Chasing Numbers** | High volume with bad form | Focus on quality reps first

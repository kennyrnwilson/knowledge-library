EOY 2025

2025 has been a bit of a rollercoaster and included, getting promoted to staff engineer, losing management responsibility for a while and then taking on a bigger management role at the end of summer. 

  

At time of writing I have been head of discretionary pre trade for 3 months so I want to focus on that role as that is what I will be doing going forward. In many ways my time so far has been spent getting used to the increase in responsibilities. There are now significant increased demands on my time. Managing 6 people, increased reporting, planning and meetings mean I have struggled to really get time to increase my knowledge of the systems I now look after but have had minimal insolvent in for years. 

  

I find it very hard to do anything well as I am constantly pulled from pillar to post. I will have one urgent support issue and set a task to write it up but before I do I will be pulled onto the next thing. 

  

I have spent significant time on trying to keep up with the AI revolution. While it could be argued that I should perhaps be spending my precious time or higher impact activities I doubt the market will kind to technologists and technology managers who do not embrace and understands this disruptive tool. 

  

Stakeholder management is certainly a lot harder this year than last. I did identify this in the managers survey but I believe it was not one of the top topics and as such won’t be covered. I have struggled to build and maintain relationships with key stakeholders who have less buy in to the Man OMS than previous stakeholders. 

  

In many ways the last three months have been a steep learning curve. I have had to learn and apply the standard operating procedures for the new role. Learn what is needed and expected for each meeting and try and help plan and deliver OKRs against a backdrop of constant uncertainty and change. I think I did a decent job of the Q4 OKRs and we will get a good few of them ticked off.

  

I feel I have the respect and buy in from my senior reports and that they are working for me well to meet our objectives against a backdrop of under resourcing and dynamic priorities.

# Archive

**Purpose:** Cold storage for deprecated content, outdated notes, and historical reference materials.

## What Goes Here

- Outdated guidance and procedures
- Superseded notes and knowledge
- Completed projects (after learning capture)
- Old fleeting notes (after processing)
- Deprecated guides and templates
- Historical records

## Archive Guidelines

**When to Archive:**
- Content is no longer relevant or outdated
- Concepts have been replaced by better versions
- Projects have been completed and learnings captured
- Notes are 3+ months old with no updates

**How to Archive:**
1. Move file to appropriate year folder
2. Add a note about why it was archived
3. Update any index files that referenced it
4. Keep for historical reference

|--------|-------|--------|
| [2024](./2024/index.md) | Previous year | Complete |
| [Deprecated Guides](./deprecated-guides/index.md) | Outdated frameworks | Growing |

- Looking up historical decisions
- Understanding how approaches evolved
- Finding outdated but potentially useful information
- Recovering concepts from past learning

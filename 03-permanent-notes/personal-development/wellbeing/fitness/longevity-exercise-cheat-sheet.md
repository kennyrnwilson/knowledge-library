## Programming Principles

### Frequency & Volume

- Train each movement pattern 2x per week
- 3-4 sets per exercise
- Rest adequately between sessions (48 hours for same muscle group)

### Progression

- Start with bodyweight or light weight
- Focus on perfect form first
- Progress weight gradually when form is solid
- Consistency matters more than heavy loads

### Integration

Include these movements in a broader training program:
- 2-3 sessions per week minimum
- Combine pushing and pulling movements
- Add lower body work for balance
- Recovery (sleep, nutrition) is critical

## Why These Movements Matter

**Functional Strength:** These movements translate to real-world capabilities—climbing stairs, carrying objects, maintaining posture, preventing falls.

**Joint Health:** Proper loading and mobility work prevent injuries and degenerative joint disease.

**Bone Density:** Weight-bearing and resistance training maintain bone mineral density as you age.

**Metabolic Health:** Muscle maintenance supports metabolic rate and glucose control.

**Independence:** Building and maintaining strength preserves independence and quality of life as you age.

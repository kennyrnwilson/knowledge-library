## Key Principles

### Body Composition Fundamentals

- You can't build muscle and lose fat simultaneously (calories can't be present and absent)
- Instead, cycle between **bulking** (muscle gain) and **cutting** (fat loss) phases
- Your lifting stays the same whether bulking or cutting

### Progressive Overload

- Getting stronger in the 5-15 rep range drives muscle growth
- Track lifts and progressively increase weight
- This is the foundation of hypertrophy

### Training Structure

- 3-5 sets per exercise, 5-15 rep range
- ~20 sets per workout is ideal (min: any sets, max: 25)
- Don't train more than 10 sets for single muscle in one workout
- Compound movements (presses, pulls, squats) provide foundation
- Add isolation movements to complement compounds

### Consistency > Perfection

- Better to train 3x/week forever than 5x/week inconsistently
- Something is always better than nothing
- Think of movement like brushing teeth—a daily habit

## How This Fits In

## Next Steps

- Choose a training split that fits your schedule
- Focus on progressive overload
- Cycle between bulk and cut phases intentionally
- Prioritize consistency over perfection

# Python Programming

**Purpose:** Core Python knowledge from fundamentals through advanced patterns and professional practices.

## Contents

Topics to build:
- [ ] Fundamentals (syntax, data types, control flow)
- [ ] Data Structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- [ ] Functions & Modular Code
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] Standard Library Modules
- [ ] Testing & Debugging
- [ ] Professional Practices (packaging, virtual environments)
- [ ] Code Quality (linting, formatting, type hints)

## Learning Path

1. **Fundamentals** - Basic syntax and data types
2. **Data Structures** - Working with collections
3. **Functions** - Modular, reusable code
4. **OOP** - Building larger systems
5. **Standard Library** - Built-in tools
6. **Professional Skills** - Production-ready code

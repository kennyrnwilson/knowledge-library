## Core Principles

### Clarity First

Clear expectations, clear feedback, clear priorities. Ambiguity creates friction and poor decisions.

### Action Over Aspiration

Don't plan the perfect 1:1 template or development program. Have the conversation, take the action, iterate.

### Presence Matters

Your availability, engagement, and energy set the tone. Show up fully.

### Feedback is a Gift

Give it promptly, specifically, and kindly. Avoid feedback is silent rejection of the person.

### Development is Your Job

Your job isn't just output—it's developing your people. This is a core management responsibility.

## Red Flags (What NOT to Do)

- ❌ Avoid difficult conversations
- ❌ Treat 1:1s as status meetings
- ❌ Give feedback only during reviews
- ❌ Create ambiguous expectations
- ❌ Play favorites with team members
- ❌ Gossip or share confidential information
- ❌ Make decisions without team input
- ❌ Forget team members' names or goals
- ❌ Blame team for your mistakes
- ❌ Spend more time with top performers, neglecting struggling members

## Implementation

Start simple:

1. **This week:** Have one developmental 1:1 with each direct report
2. **This month:** Address one issue that's been pending
3. **This quarter:** Ensure clear goals and development plans for team
4. **Ongoing:** Weekly 1:1s, daily visibility, monthly strategic alignment

Don't create a perfect system. Start with these habits and iterate.

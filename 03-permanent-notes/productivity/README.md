# Productivity

**Purpose:** Efficiency, systems, time management, and getting things done effectively.

## Contents

### Core Topics

- [Time Management](./time-management/README.md) - Calendars, scheduling, and time blocking
- [Goal Setting & Achievement](./goal-setting/README.md) - Dreams, systems, and progress
- [Focus & Deep Work](./focus-deep-work/README.md) - Concentration, flow, and meaningful work

## Key Principles

### Systems Over Goals

- Goals set direction, systems create progress
- Build repeatable processes that make success inevitable
- Focus on what you can do today, repeatedly
- Small repeated actions compound into big results

### Slow Productivity Philosophy

- Shift from pseudo-productivity (visible activity) to real productivity (quality output)
- Do fewer things with better focus
- Work at a natural, sustainable pace
- Obsess over quality of output, not volume of activity

### Dream Management System

- **Dreams** (life vision): 10-year visualization
- **Goals** (outcomes): Quarterly, monthly, weekly targets
- **Habits** (daily actions): The "five to strive" daily system
- Chunk backwards from future vision to present actions

# Focus & Deep Work

**Purpose:** Concentration practices, flow states, and meaningful work without distraction.

## Key Principles

### Deep Work Definition

- Cognitively demanding work requiring full concentration
- Focused effort on complex problems and skill development
- Opposite of shallow work (email, meetings, administrative tasks)
- Produces the most valuable output with smallest effort

### The Overhead Tax

- Each project incurs overhead (meetings, communication, updates)
- Multiple concurrent projects multiply overhead exponentially
- Fewer projects = more time for actual deep work
- Sequential projects minimize overhead

### Make Before You Manage

- Protect first hours of day for creative/deep work
- *Before* checking email, messages, or admin tasks
- Sets positive emotional tone
- Prevents reactive tasks from consuming all mental energy

### The Critical Caution

Much of the self-help and productivity industry is:
- **Profit-driven:** measured by book sales, not outcomes
- **Oversimplified:** logically inconsistent or contextually incomplete
- **Ceremonial:** creates illusion of progress without real action
- **Planful:** lots of planning, not enough doing

**The core truth:**
> Reading about productivity isn't being productive.
> Journaling about dreams isn't achieving them.
> Taking one concrete step beats consuming ten hours of content.

## Quick Principles

1. **Deep work requires distraction-free blocks** - 90 minutes optimal
2. **Consistency builds capacity** - daily practice makes focus easier
3. **Environment matters** - eliminate distractions, optimize context
4. **Protect morning mental energy** - do deep work before meetings/email
5. **Quality beats quantity** - 2 hours deep work > 8 hours shallow
6. **Systems > motivation** - rely on habits, not willpower
7. **Action > planning** - one step beats endless preparation

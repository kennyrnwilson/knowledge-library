**Purpose:** Frameworks for translating dreams into action through systems and habits.

## Key Principles

### Systems vs. Goals

**Goals set direction, systems create progress.**

- Goals: All-or-nothing, short-lived, motivation collapses after achievement
- Systems: Continuous success, flexible, compound growth

### The Three-Level Framework

1. **Dreams** (Vision): 10-year life visualization
2. **Goals** (Outcomes): Quarterly, monthly, weekly targets
3. **Habits** (Action): The "five to strive" daily system

### Core Truth

"You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems."

Success requires systematic connection of all three levels throughout the year.

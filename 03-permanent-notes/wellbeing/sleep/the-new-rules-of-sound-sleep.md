## Summary

Sleep is the ultimate performance and recovery tool. It supports tissue repair, boosts immunity, and improves reaction time and accuracy. Rather than chasing complicated recovery methods, understanding and optimizing sleep—which is free—provides the most significant gains.

## The Four Pillars of Sleep (QQRT)

### 1. Quantity

**Target:** 7-9 hours per night for most adults

- Only 1-3% of people are "super sleepers" who need <6 hours
- Most people are chronically sleep deprived
- Use a sleep tracker to measure actual sleep time vs. time in bed

### 2. Quality

#### Light & Dark Management

- **Morning:** Get light in your eyes immediately upon waking
- **Evening:** Dim lights 1 hour before bed to boost melatonin
- **Blue light:** Dimming screens helps you wind down (mixed research overall)

#### Temperature Control

- **Bedroom:** Keep at ~18°C (64°F)
- **Body:** Core temperature needs to drop 2°C for sleep
- **Hot sleepers:** Avoid cotton; try moisture-wicking materials
- **Socks:** Warming feet can promote faster sleep onset

#### Caffeine & Alcohol

- Cut caffeine: 10 hours before bed
- Limit: Max 3 cups coffee/day (300-400mg caffeine)
- Alcohol: Disrupts sleep cycles even if you fall asleep easily

### 3. Regularity (Most Important Factor)

**Consistent sleep/wake times** is the most important optimization.

- **Goal:** Same 30-60 minute window every day
- **Why:** Helps body trust and optimize sleep cycles
- **Tip:** Combine with light therapy (sunrise alarm clocks)

#### Sleep Stages Benefits

- **REM Sleep:** Learning, memory consolidation, emotional regulation
- **Deep Sleep:** Physical recovery, blood pressure regulation, anxiety reduction
- **Pro tip:** Adding 15-20 min morning sleep provides more REM

### 4. Timing

Different chronotypes need different sleep schedules.

- **Night owl vs. Early bird:** Largely genetic
- **Find out:** Take an online MEQ (morningness-eveningness questionnaire)
- **Benefit:** Stop forcing unnatural sleep schedules

## Can't Fall Asleep?

### The 25-Minute Rule

If not asleep after 25 minutes, get out of bed.

### Better Alternatives

- Guided breathing or meditation
- Read something calming
- Use "demanding books": Dense, informative books tire you out without disrupting sleep (bite-sized information means you can stop at any paragraph)
- Listen to music or podcasts
- Try "cognitive shuffling" (think of words starting with each letter of "BEDTIME")
- Alphabet games (animals, foods, etc.)

### Avoid

- Bright screens
- Midnight snacks
- Physical activity
- Emotional stimulation

## Helpful Tools & Apps

### Sleep Apps

- **Calm** - Sleep stories & morning meditations
- **Headspace** - Audio-guided sleepcasts
- **Reveri** - Hypnotherapy for sleep
- **Waking Up** - Meditation theory & practice

### Sound Solutions

- iPhone white noise (Settings > Accessibility > Audio & Visual)
- Pink/brown noise for blocking outside sounds
- Sleep timers to auto-stop audio

### Exercise Bonus

Any cardiovascular exercise or strength training boosts deep sleep time—even a 10-minute walk helps!

## Priority Order for Optimization

1. **Regularity** - Set consistent sleep/wake times
2. **Quantity** - Aim for 7-9 hours
3. **Quality** - Manage light, temperature, caffeine
4. **Timing** - Align with your chronotype

## Quick Wins (Free)

1. Set consistent bedtime/wake time
2. Keep bedroom at 18°C
3. Get morning light, dim evening lights
4. Cut caffeine 10 hours before bed
5. Move your body daily (even 10-minute walk)

## Key Takeaway

Sleep beats expensive recovery tools every time. Focus on these evidence-based pillars rather than chasing supplements or optimization gadgets.

## Summary

Paced breathing is a rhythmic, mindful breathing technique that slows your breath rate to calm the nervous system. It replaces shallow, stressed breathing with steady, deep, intentional breaths, helping your mind and body find balance.

## How It Works

### Nervous System Activation

- **Activates relaxation:** Slows the heart rate by engaging the parasympathetic ("rest and digest") system
- **Improves emotional control:** Increases awareness, allowing you to respond—not react—under pressure
- **Balances the brain:** Links breath rhythm to calm activity in emotional brain centers

### Why It's Powerful

Your breath is one of the few automatic processes you can consciously control. By controlling breath, you signal your nervous system to calm down.

## How to Practice

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Find comfort:** Sit, stand, or lie down with a relaxed posture
2. **Notice your breath:** Observe your natural rhythm for a few seconds
3. **Inhale through your nose:** Slowly count to 4–5 seconds and let your belly expand
4. **(Optional) Hold:** Pause your breath gently for 4–7 seconds
5. **Exhale slowly:** Breathe out through your mouth for 6–8 seconds—slightly longer than your inhale
6. **Repeat:** Continue for 5–10 minutes or until calm

### Key Principle

**Make your exhale longer than your inhale** to tap into deep calm. Longer exhalation is what activates the parasympathetic system.

## Common Breathing Patterns

### "4-7-8" Technique

- Inhale for **4** seconds
- Hold for **7** seconds
- Exhale for **8** seconds
- Repeat for **4–8 cycles**

### Box Breathing

- Inhale for **4** seconds
- Hold for **4** seconds
- Exhale for **4** seconds
- Hold for **4** seconds
- Repeat

### Equal Rhythm

- Inhale for **5** seconds
- Exhale for **5** seconds
- Repeat (simplest pattern to start with)

## Tips for Success

### Building the Practice

- Practice **daily**, even when relaxed—consistency strengthens emotional resilience
- Start with 5 minutes and gradually increase
- Try different patterns to find what resonates with you
- Use before stressful situations, after workouts, or before bed

### Breathing Mechanics

- Breathe through your nose for inhale (filters air, increases nitric oxide)
- Can exhale through mouth or nose (mouth exhale often feels more releasing)
- Breathe into your belly, not your chest
- Maintain upright posture when possible

### Consistency Matters

Regular practice when calm builds your capacity to access this technique when stressed. You can't "turn on" paced breathing for the first time during a crisis.
